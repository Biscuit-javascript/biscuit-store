## State

State is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to change behavior depending on their state. From the outside, it seems that the object class has changed.

### Standard pattern of state
The [store](/docs/core/STORE.md) article already mentioned that the state is a reference to the storage object.
> It will also be useful for you to know that if you create two repositories that have actions with the same name, then these repositories will be linked to an object of the same state. This logic is used for optimization.

Here's what it will look like:

```javascript

createStore({
    name: "test-1",
    initial: {},
    actions: {
        add: "add/action"
    }
})

createStore({
    name: "test-2",
    initial: {},
    actions: {
        add: "add/action"
    }
})
```
Under the hood, the state store will look like this:
```
_states:
|____add/action:
|________test-1:
|____________link to object (test-1)
|________test-2:
|____________link to object (test-2)
```

### Branch pattern for the state
In the article about [store](/docs/core/STORE.md), the states converted to branches were already mentioned, and here I will tell you more about them.
In fact, the concept of a branch is very simple. If the normal state is a reference to the store object. Then the branch is a copy of the store object in an isolated state.

And if we want to merge a branch with the main store or, for example, with another branch, then we need to use a special set of methods from the [manager](/docs/core/MANAGER.md) constructor.

> This is actually very similar to the branching system in GIT

This is how we can create a branch:
```javascript
...
const testStore = createStore({
    name: "test",
    initial: {},
    actions: {
        sandbox: {
            name: "sandbox/action",
            branch: true,
            initial: { value: 0 }
        },
    }
})

export { add, sandbox } = testStore.actions
export { store } = testStore
```
As you can see, the branch has its initial state, which will be concatenated with a copy of the store object.

Now let's try to test it:
```javascript
import { sandbox, store } from "./testStore";

store.subscribe((repo) => {
    console.log(repo); // {}
});

sandbox.subscribe((state) => {
    console.log(state); // { value: 1 }
});

sandbox.dispatch({value: 1});
```
There is a quick way to send data from a branch to a store without using a manager:

```javascript
sandbox.dispatch({value: 1}).merge();
```

Branches can be useful in many cases... For example, if you want to create some versioning, or you just need to store a few sample data.

> Branches are an interesting tool. But I urge you to be careful with it and not use it unnecessarily... Playing with bifurcated States, you can call the paradox of [Schr√∂dinger cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat). =)

Next, we will study manager.
