## Subscribe decorator
Subscribe is a decorator that allows you to bind a set of parameters and managers of your biscuit-store to a component.

**This function will seem extremely similar to [Connect](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect) from [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/). And so it is.**

>Initially, I did not plan to add this feature to the biscuit arsenal, but after careful thought, I came to the conclusion that this functionality fits perfectly into the flexible architecture of biscuit. And also subscribe will allow you to implement biscuit in such an approach as [ARc](https://arc.js.org/).
